# Ulrack CLI Edition

This package contains the base project for a CLI package using Ulrack.

## Installation

To create a new project, run the following command:

```
composer create-project ulrack/cli-edition
```

## Usage

This project can be used to setup a CLI application using PHP.
The documentation of the following packages can be helpful to read prior to
starting development.
- [Why the locator.php file?](https://github.com/grizz-it/configuration/blob/master/docs/usage/adding-a-locator.md)
- [How to create commands](https://github.com/ulrack/cli-application/blob/master/docs/usage/create-a-command.md)
- [How services work](https://github.com/ulrack/services#usage)
- [How the kernel works](https://github.com/ulrack/kernel/blob/master/docs/index.md)
- [Install the PECL YAML dependency](https://github.com/grizz-it/codec/blob/master/docs/usage/index.md)

The following "invisible" services are available from the kernel:
- `services.core.object.manager`
- `services.core.codec.manager`
- `services.core.resource.manager`
- `services.core.cache.manager`
- `services.core.validation.manager`
- `services.core.service.manager`
- `services.core.configuration.manager`
- `services.core.object.manager`

Their names directly correlate to the Kernel managers that can be found in the
[ulrack/kernel](https://github.com/ulrack/kernel/tree/master/src/Component/Kernel/Manager)
package. However it is recommended to avoid using these as much as possible,
unless explicitely required.

The `bin/application` file can be freely renamed to anything else.
To turn the file into an executable, run the following command:
```bash
chmod u+x bin/application
```

If there are any questions, never hesitate to ask! :)
